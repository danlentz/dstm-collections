1. collect-decls uses nlet (i.e., not nlet-tail) which I don't see in your code or in Doug Hoyte's LOL code. I
assume this is just a macro for a scheme-like named-let, yes? I've rewritten collect-decls using loop,
but I'd be happy to have your version of nlet.

2. You appear to rely on some utilities from your butterfly package in your test code at the end. I appreciate
that you may not want to publish butterfly, but could you let me know if my translation of the following into
vanilla lispworks mp code is on the mark?

bfly:log-info 
(I assume this is just an ordinary logging function so this should be simple)

bfly:spawn
(I assume this is something like mp:process-run-function, but if there are significant differences, let
me know)

Anyway, using Doug Hoyte's LOL code (with some eval-whens added - apparently Doug Hoyte doesn't compile
his code) and the modifications noted above I've gotten your HDSTM to compile and the test to run. FWIW, it
consumes between ~125% - 175% cpu, I show no invariant violations while running, and when done, *nrolls*
is 30458 and *ntrans* is 4030458. I'm running on a 2.53GHz Core2 Duo.

Thanks again for sharing this - really interesting stuff!
