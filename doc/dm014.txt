Yes... I find that if I place the sys:ensure-memory-after-store just  
ahead of the reads (the defensive approach), my CPU utilization goes  
upwards of 150-170%, and the code takes about 30 seconds for 5 million  
iterations.

Placing that MFENCE just after the rebindings drops the CPU  
utilization a bit, and the same iterations take about 37 seconds.

Interesting... at least for these highly preliminary results. I  
wouldn't want to bet my life on these conclusions. But it is  
interesting that the initial tests point toward doing the safer  
approach and not relying on programmers to have flushed their bindings  
to memory.
