Hi,

I'm looking for a (portable) way to assign a total order to all Lisp  
objects, regardless of type. The present context is in relation to  
grabbing multiprocessing locks in a consistent order. But this problem  
has reared its head numerous times in the past. The order need not be  
consistent from one Lisp session to the next, but within one session  
the order should be consistent and unambiguous.

Hash tables seem to have some magic, in some implementations, so that  
any Lisp object can be used as a key. Yet if you go by SXHASH, then  
all the difficult types of objects get assigned to the same bucket.  
There are implementations that do much better than this, but it is  
implementation dependent, hence non-portable.

In the past, I resorted to PRINC representations when all else failed.  
But that is horribly slow. At other times I have used the network  
serialization byte vector of objects -- but that only works for  
portable objects, and it is even slower.

Any ideas?
