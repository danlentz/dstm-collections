Also... I'm not yet fully convinced that my little test routine  
measures anything of importance. I just took out all the MFENCEs and  
the code didn't give any indication of broken invariants. And the code  
ran about the same speed (37 sec) as when placing MFENCE just after  
rebindings of volatile slots.

So it would be useful to have a discussion about valid test  
approaches. This was just something I slapped together quickly. But  
because the Herlihy DSTM allows data invariants to be violated in the  
inside of atomic transactions, I had to quickly modify the code from  
its original form and place the invariants query outside of the first  
atomic transaction.

But in so doing, have I compromised my tests? I still have to convince  
myself that it really tests anything at all...
