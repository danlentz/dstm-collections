Here's a version that offers several compromises:

1. Uses Time-Order (TO) protocol, so that each var has both read &  
write timestamps. You know immediately when you need to rollback. And  
you get the advantage of preserved invariants inside the body of the  
transaction. I.e., if the transaction makes it through the invariant  
checking without being rolled back, then the invariant will be  
satisfied (assuming it is correct to begin with).

Rules of TO:
        a) Given TS the timestamp for a transaction, RTS the read timestamp  
on the variable, and WTS the write timestamp on a variable,
        b) For reads:
                If TS < WTS then rollback -- someone from future has already updated  
the var
                otherwise, set RTS to Max(RTS, TS)

        c) For writes:
                If TS < RTS then rollback -- someone from future has already read  
the var
                If TS < WTS then skip the write -- it has already been overwritten  
by someone from future
                otherwise set WTS = TS and write the new value into the var

2. Uses shared locks with multiple readers, single writer. In order to  
update the read time-stamps properly, a CAS operation is used in the  
read-var routine.

3. Runs about 3/4 of the speed of the lock-free DSTM (still pretty  
good!) I'm seeing about 600 KTrans/sec, with rollback percentages well  
below 1% (typ 0.15%).

4. Uses a hybrid architecture so that commit and rollback remain  
trivial, a la DSTM. And no need (thanks to TO) for commit time  
checking that vars haven't changed beneath you. So no consing of vars  
visited for reading. Just flip the transaction state from :ACTIVE  
to :ABORTED or :COMMITTED.

5. Since read / write can rollback at any time, it is no longer  
permitted to have naked read / write. We automatically wrap them in an  
ATOMIC if they are presented as naked. Otherwise, you could be getting  
rollback-exception errors in your code.
